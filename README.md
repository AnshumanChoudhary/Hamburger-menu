# Hamburger-menu

I have created a hamburger menu in website using HTML and CSS.

This webpage is created using CSS media queries, that adapts into a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes thus providing a mobile-friendly navigation
menu that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
